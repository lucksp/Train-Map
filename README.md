# BuildIt: Training Map

This repo is based on the following requirements:

Build a single page application to visualize the workout data provided in `data.json`, including a map, a graph, and an algorithm to analyze average power output.

## Algorithm

- Write the most efficient method that finds the "best" 20 minute power effort.
- "Best" is defined as highest continuous average for the given time period.

## User Interface

- Display the gps path on a Map
- Display the power output over time on a graph, using time as the X axis
- When user selects a range of time on the graph, highlight the corresponding range on the map
- Display the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute "best" efforts

# To Build & Run app:

- run `npm install` after repo is cloned.
- run `npm run dev` to view in local development environment.
- You can use `yarn` equivalents if you prefer.
